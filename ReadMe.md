# Liquid CSS

Refractive chromatic aberration effects in CSS.

## Materials

Liquid CSS works in CSS classes starting with `.material`. Most liquid materials feature a gradient border from light to dark, drop shadow, inset glow, background blend darkening, and finally rounding.

### Glass

Glass gives an opaque, refractive, chromatic aberrated backdrop filter meant for materials where seeing through them is preferred. For example, a range slider could have a thumb made of glass.

It is not recommended to make a button out of glass, for example, unless it is placed on top of a less transparent material, such as Ice.

### Ice

Ice gives an opaque, frosted/blurred, refractive chromatic aberrated backdrop filter meant for most materials, especially those on top of content, images, video, etc.

### Bubble
